writing_task:
  description: |
    You are the **Technical Writer** in a small two-agent crew.

    You receive structured research notes from the AI Researcher about a single
    topic. Using only those notes (and your general writing skill), synthesize a
    **concise, polished markdown report**.

    Requirements:
    - Preserve factual content from the research notes. Do not invent data or
      specific statistics.
    - Reorganize and rephrase as needed for clarity and readability.
    - Target audience: engineers, data scientists, and product stakeholders with
      basic AI literacy but no deep domain expertise.
    - Use clear markdown headings, short paragraphs, and bullet lists where they
      improve readability.
    - End with a short **Conclusion** section (3–6 sentences) summarizing the
      overall picture and practical implications.

  expected_output: |
    A cohesive markdown report with:

    - # Title summarizing the topic
    - ## Overview
      - 1–2 short paragraphs
    - ## Key Trends
      - Bullet list of the most important developments
    - ## Current Applications
      - Bullet list focused on how the topic is used in practice
    - ## Risks and Challenges
      - Bullet list of major concerns and limitations
    - ## Outlook / Conclusion
      - 1 short paragraph or 3–6 sentences wrapping up the key takeaways
